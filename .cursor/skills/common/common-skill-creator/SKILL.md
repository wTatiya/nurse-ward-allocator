# Agent Skill Creator Standard

## **Priority: P0 — Apply to ALL skills**

Maximize **Token ROI**. Every line in SKILL.md must provide specific procedural value. **Activation** (how it triggers) and **Implementation** (how it helps) primary quality metrics.

## Three-Level Loading System

- **Level 1** Frontmatter: `name` + `description` (Activation Anchor), ≤100 words.
- **Level 2** SKILL.md body: Core Rules + Workflows (Implementation Core), ≤100 lines.
- **Level 3** references/: Detailed examples, schemas, and "TESTS.md" (On-demand).

## Workflow (New or Existing Skill)
**New skill:**
1. **Research** — web-search domain best practices, checklists, and standards; extract key terms → triggers, workflows → guidelines, mistakes → anti-patterns. See [Web Search Research](references/web-search-research.md).
2. **Capture intent** — what it , when it trigger, expected output format?
3. **Draft the SKILL.md** — draft using [TEMPLATE.md](references/TEMPLATE.md)
4. **Test** — spawn parallel subagents: one with-skill, one without-skill (baseline)
5. **Evaluate** — grade assertions, review benchmark (pass rate, tokens, time)
6. **Iterate** — rewrite based on feedback, rerun into next iteration dir, repeat
7. **Optimize description** — run trigger eval queries, target ≥80% accuracy
8. **Pressure-test** — for discipline skills, capture agent excuses, red flags, and stop conditions
   **Existing skill:**
9. **Audit** — run Quality Checklist below; identify violations
10. **Snapshot** — `cp -r <skill-dir> <workspace>/skill-snapshot/` before any edits
11. **Improve SKILL.md** — fix violations, compress, move oversized content to `references/`
12. **Test** — spawn parallel subagents: one with-new-skill, one with-snapshot (baseline)
13. **Evaluate & iterate** — same as steps 4–5 above
14. **Optimize description** — re-run trigger eval if description changed
15. **Harden** — add rationalization counters where agents still fail under pressure
    See [Eval Workflow](references/eval-workflow.md) for full testing + iteration details.

## Description Quality (Activation)

- **Third-Person Voice**: Use `Standardizes...`, `Audits...`, `Encrypts...`. Avoid "I will" or "This skill helps to".
- **What + When Structure**:
- **What**: Define 5–8 specific capabilities (e.g., "Generates JWT tokens, rotates keys").
- **When**: Explicitly define triggers (e.g., "Use when user says 'rotate keys'").
- **Specificity**: Avoid vague verbs like "manage" or "handle". Use "Validate", "Inject", "Refactor", "Sanitize".
- **Trigger Hint**: Include `(triggers: *.ext, keyword)` suffix for technical skills.
## Content Quality (Implementation)

- **No Redundant Knowledge**: **NOT** explain concepts AI already knows (e.g., HTTP status codes, standard library docs, basic SOLID principles). Focus strictly on _project-specific_ rules.
- **Caveman Compression**: Use "Caveman Mode" for rules to save tokens. Drop articles (, , ), remove filler words ("should", "will", "), and use telegraphic snippets.
- _Standard_: "You should ensure that database connection closed after every query to prevent leaks." (15 tokens)
- _Caveman_: "Close DB connection after query. Prevent leaks." (7 tokens)
- **Actionability**: Examples must copy-paste ready and executable.
- **Workflow Clarity**: Use sequential ordered lists for multi-step processes.
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Move code blocks >10 lines to `references/`.
- **Pressure Hardening**: Discipline skills must name red flags, common excuses, and exact stop/restart conditions.
## Behavior Guardrails

- **Use pressure tests for discipline skills**: TDD, debugging, verification, review, protocol, and workflow skills need baseline failure evidence.
- **Capture rationalizations**: Save the exact excuses agents use when they skip the rule.
- **Add red flags**: Short phrases that tell the agent to stop and restart the protocol.
- **Encode behavior in evals**: Add `pressure_scenarios`, `rationalizations`, `red_flags`, and `behavior_assertions` when the skill is guardrail-oriented.
- **Keep it local**: Put behavior details in evals or `references/`; keep `SKILL.md` compact.
## Anti-Patterns

- **No "AI-splaining"**: not explain why pattern good unless it's unique project constraint.
- **No Vague Triggers**: Never use `src/**` or `**/*`. surgical.
- **No Description Bloat**: If description exceeds 100 words, some capabilities belong in body.
- **No long code blocks**: >10 lines → extract to `references/`
- **No redundancy**: don't repeat frontmatter content in body
- **No untested guardrails**: Rules that were never pressure-tested are speculation.
## Quality Checklist (Tessl-Aligned)

- [ ] **Activation ≥ 90%**: Description covers both capabilities ("What") and triggers ("When").
- [ ] **Implementation ≥ 90%**: No general-purpose explanations; all examples executable.
- [ ] **Structural Compliance**: SKILL.md ≤ 100 lines; code blocks moved to `references/`.
- [ ] Trigger rate ≥80% on should-trigger queries.
- [ ] Guardrail skills include rationalizations, red flags, and behavior eval fields.
