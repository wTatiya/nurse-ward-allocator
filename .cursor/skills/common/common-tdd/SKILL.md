# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Standard

## **Priority: P0 — Iron Law**

> **NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT FAILING TEST FIRST.**
> Code written before test MUST deleted. Start over.

## **Step 1: RGR Loop (Red-Green-Refactor)**

> [!TIP]
> **Orchestration**: If sub-agents are available, delegate each AC implementation to `specialist-tdd-implementer`.

1. **RED**: Write minimal failing test. **Verify failure** (Expected error, not typo).
2. **GREEN**: Write simplest code to pass. **Verify pass**.
3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up code while staying green.

## **Red Flags**

- **Stop if code exists before test**: Delete it. Restart from RED.
- **Stop if test passes first run**: You tested old behavior.
- **Stop if "tests after" appears**: That is not TDD.

## **AAA Structure (Mandatory)**

Every test must follow Arrange-Act-Assert:

- **Arrange**: Set up inputs, stubs, mocks, and expected values.
- **Act**: Call single unit under test.
- **Assert**: Verify output and side effects. One logical assertion per test.
  **(See [AAA Example](references/aaa_example.md) for code structure)**.

## **Step 3: Verification & Thresholds**

- **Minimum Coverage**: 80% (Stat/Func/Line), 75% (Branch).
- **Mocks**:
- Always mock: HTTP, Time/Date, Filesystem.
- Never mock: Fast internal services (<200ms), pure domain logic.
- See [Test Runner Reference](references/test_runners.md) for environment-specific commands.

## **Step 4: Principles & Mocks**

- **Watch it Fail**: Prove test works before writing code.
- **Minimalism**: Don't add features/options beyond current test (YAGNI).
- **Isolation**: Mock external APIs (HTTP) and Time.
- **Realism**: Prefer real DBs (test containers) and fast internal services (<200ms).

## **Rationalization Prevention**

- **"Too small to test"**: Small code still regresses. Write the test.
- **"Manual testing is enough"**: Manual checks do not prove the RED step.
- **"Keep code as reference"**: Pre-test code biases the implementation. Delete it.
- **"Tests after are equivalent"**: Passing immediately proves little.

## **Verification Checklist**

- [ ] Every new function/method failing test first?
- [ ] Failure message expected?
- [ ] Minimal code implemented passed?
- [ ] AAA structure followed?
- [ ] Coverage thresholds met?

## Anti-Patterns

- **No test-after**: Writing tests post-implementation defeats TDD. Delete and restart.
- **No assertion-free tests**: test without assert not test.
- **No testing implementation**: Test behavior and contracts, not internal calls.
